## Reflection
As of the ,ost recent save, the only thing that I do not have at the moment is teh audio files saved into the game. I have a titel screen and such, but it does not really loop. I tried to get my GoDot engine fixed with the tech desk but they could not find anything to fix it yet, so I am still working in intervals before the system shuts down. It is also not saving everything. Once I push my code to GitHub, it erases it in GoDot. So, each class reverts back to the default code editor structure. So, now I have to go back and copy/paste the code back into GoDot and redo all the little things like images and sound files.
